# 📊 Unemployment Analysis with Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes unemployment rate data (percentage of unemployed people) to understand employment trends, the impact of Covid-19, seasonal patterns, and policy-relevant insights.  
The analysis is performed using Python with a strong focus on **data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation**, rather than complex modeling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

- Analyze unemployment rate data representing unemployed people (%)
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis using Python
- Visualize unemployment trends over time
- Investigate the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment rates
- Identify seasonal and volatility patterns
- Derive insights that can inform economic and social policies

---

## 📂 Dataset Used
- **Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv**
- Contains time-based unemployment rate data (monthly)
- Key column analyzed:
  - `Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)`

> Note: Although multiple datasets were provided, this dataset was sufficient to address all project objectives effectively.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Loaded data using Pandas
- Stripped column name whitespaces
- Converted date column to datetime format
- Checked and confirmed:
  - No missing values
  - No duplicate records
- Sorted data chronologically for time-series analysis

## 📊 Analysis & Visualizations
The analysis was structured around **10 key questions**, including:

1. Overall unemployment trend over time  
2. Impact of Covid-19 (before, during, after lockdowns)  
3. Monthly/seasonal unemployment patterns  
4. Months with consistently high unemployment  
5. Regional differences in unemployment  
6. Regions most affected during Covid-19  
7. Post-Covid recovery differences across regions  
8. Volatility of unemployment using rolling standard deviation  
9. Highest and lowest unemployment values observed  
10. Policy-relevant insights based on observed trends  

### Visualization Techniques Used
- Line plots (trend analysis)
- Boxplots (seasonality & regional consistency)
- Bar charts (monthly and regional comparisons)
- Rolling standard deviation plots (volatility)
- Interactive Plotly charts (region-wise recovery analysis)

Libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Unemployment was relatively stable before 2020.
- A sharp spike occurred during early 2020 due to Covid-19 lockdowns.
- April–May 2020 showed the highest unemployment and volatility.
- Recovery after Covid was gradual and uneven.
- Strong regional differences indicate that unemployment impacts were not uniform.
- Volatility analysis highlights how sudden economic shocks affect employment stability.

---

## 🏛️ Policy Implications
- Emergency job-protection measures are critical during economic shocks.
- Recovery programs should be long-term, not short-term.
- Region-specific employment policies are more effective than uniform solutions.
- Strengthening social safety nets can reduce vulnerability during crises.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how meaningful insights can be extracted from unemployment data through proper data cleaning, visualization, and analytical thinking.  
Rather than focusing on complexity, the project emphasizes **clarity, reasoning, and real-world relevance**, which are core skills of a data analyst.
